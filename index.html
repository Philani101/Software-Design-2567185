            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
              I most recent took part in a team project that involved the creation of <br>
              an information system for a business. This required extensive amounts of <br>
              planning and teamwork. We were in a space where we had to make use of not only <br>
              our technical skills but also our analystic skills and knowledge.
