In this lab I used Git and Github to learn how to manage branches. The first task was to initialize my Git repository and ensure it contains the required files. I was also tasked with making atleast two meaningful commits, creating branches and deploying on GitHub pages. I learned some of the functions of the basic Git commands and how to push from my local repository to my remote one.
